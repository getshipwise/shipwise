## About Shipwise

Shipwise is an order management platform with power. Shipwise is about the interconnectivity between systems like
Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon, BigCommerce, and more. Order management should be easy to use and extensible. Shipwise
takes a API first approach and takes the pain out of managing orders. Shipwise can do many things, such as:

- Simple order management
- Connect with multiple ecommerce platforms to aggregate orders
- Connect with 3PLs and warehouses for transmitting orders
- Hook in with webhooks to connect to your own system

## How Shipwise Works

Shipwise allows users to connect with ecommerce platforms via OAuth or other means. Orders start flowing in based on
rules setup within the system. Most customers send their orders to fulfillment centers based on specific rules, this
is completely up to you though. After a fulfillment center processes an order, tracking information is then transmitted
back to the ecommerce system and your ecommerce platform handles notifying the customer.

tops of giants in a hope to become one of the few.
